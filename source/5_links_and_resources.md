#### Updated New Random Map Scripting Guide by: Zetnus (this guide!)
It might be worth checking the link to see if I have published a newer version. Also, you can leave comments there.

#### Random Map Scripting Guide (RMSG.doc) by: Ensemble Studios 
Provided in the docs folder on your CD or in `Age2HD\Docs\All` if you have the HD Edition on Steam. Has MANY errors, mistakes and omissions; so don’t trust everything written there! Contains an annotated version of the script for Coastal though, which is cool to check out.

#### Text Editors and RMS Syntax
You can write your script in just about any text editor, but getting syntax highlighting can make random map scripting much easier and faster by helping you spot mistakes as you make them. RMS syntax exists for text editors such as Notepad++, PSPad, Visual Studio, and more.  Take a look at my post at Age of Kings Heaven, where I have links to everything I have found:

## 5.1. RMS Constants
The tables earlier in this guide include most of the useful constants. However, if you want complete lists, those can be found here:

Complete List by: DiGiT (.csv)  
[http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=5810](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=5810)

Advanced List by: OtmShankIiI (.htm)  
[http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=8724](http://aok.heavengames.com/blacksmith/showfile.php?fileid=8724)  
Much better descriptions and slightly more up-to-date than the complete list above. Includes everything from AoC.
