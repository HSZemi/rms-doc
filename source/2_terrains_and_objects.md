Here are the lists of available item types, including:

- Predefined constant name, if any (otherwise use `#const`). 
- Constant number N, to be used for name definitions: `#const  name  N`
- Comments, if needed

I reported only items that look good enough to be useful in a RMS. For a complete list of constants, including defective stuff, see Links and Resources.

### 2.1.1. DLC Terrains
These terrains were added by The Forgotten, African Kingdoms, and Rise of the Rajas. For the most part, they will cause the map to CRASH if you attempt to load a map that contains them in any version of the game that does not have the required expansions.

The HD Edition DLC also adds a bunch of so-called "moddable terrains" (70-99), which look exactly like the existing terrains, but could be used if you wanted to modify terrains and make a map using those modded terrains. For example, you could make a terrain mod that turns a moddable water into the appearance of lava and then make an RMS that specifically uses this terrain.
Warning! [Wololo Kingdoms](https://github.com/AoE2CommunityGitHub/WololoKingdoms) changes some of the constant numbers. Check their documentation for how to handle this. Predefined names are automatically transitioned, but when using `#const`, you must manually deal with this.


## 2.2. Player Objects

These units and buildings can be controlled by a player. With `set_gaia_object_only`, they become rescuable.
CAPITAL names are valid predefined labels; other names are only descriptive (use `#const` for such objects).

### 2.2.11. Note on Walls

Standard walls (palisade, stone or fortified) are automatically placed in rings around player lands, including four gates (one per side), whenever you use `set_place_for_every_player`. If you use palisade walls, the stone gates will be placed in the original AoC, but HD will place palisade gates instead.
E.g. this command would create square walls with 15 tiles radius:

```rms
create_object WALL
{
set_place_for_every_player
min_distance_to_players 15
max_distance_to_players 15
}
```

- number_of_objects is ignored, so don't even type it
- `min_distance` and `max_distance` must be specified, or you get bad results
- If `max_distance` is greater than `min_distance`, you get a non-square ring, with varying radius
- You can't place more than one wall ring per player. Any further walls after the first one will end up on top of the original ring, regardless of the min and max distance specified.
- You can't place single pieces of wall (not rings) for players, and you can't place rings for gaia
- You must place the wall AFTER placing a town center for every player. If you place it before a TC is placed, or if no TCs are placed, the wall will form a ring around the center of the map instead
- Walls are not placed if the players are completely separated from each other by water
- Walls are not placed on lands created with `assign_to_player`


### 2.2.12. Other Buildings

Most of these buildings do nothing and are eye-candy only. "Not working" buildings generally can't train units, research, receive resources or fire arrows; they only have sight and potentially population support.

## 2.3. Gaia Objects

These objects can never belong to a player. `set_gaia_object_only` is required if `set_place_for_every_player` is used.
Again, capital letters names are predefined labels, while lower case names are just descriptive (you must use `#const`).
"Varies" means that the same type of object can actually have two or more different aspects (like the villagers, that can randomly be men or women), making a better eye-candy.

### 2.3.2. Trees

Unlike forest terrains, tree objects aren't visible on mini-map. Normal trees have 100 wood each. The scenario editor trees (399-410) have 125 wood and cannot be cut down with siege onagers.  AIs sometimes may not recognize them as a wood source for the purpose of choosing initial lumber camp sites.

### 2.3.4. Dead Units

These units, except for wild animals, can also be placed as player objects (with `set_place_for_every_player` and without `set_gaia_object_only`); of course they're not controllable, and only get owner's color.
All dead units decay and disappear after some time. They can be placed on water.

## 2.4. DLC Objects

These objects were added with DLC expansions to the HD Edition on Steam. For the most part, they will cause the map to CRASH if you attempt to load a map that contains them in any version of the game that does not have the required expansions
